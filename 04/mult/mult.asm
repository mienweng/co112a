// Multiplies R0 and R1 and stores the result in R2.
// (R0, R1, R2 refer to RAM[0], RAM[1], and RAM[2], respectively.)

// Put your code here.

//Take value in R0 and store it in a variable caled value1
@R0
D=M
@value1
M=D

//Take value in R1 and store it in a variable caled value2
@R1
D=M
@value2

//SET R2 to 0
@R2 
M=0

// IF value2 is 0 END THE PROGRAM
@value2

// Loop. Add value1 to r2 as long as value2 is above 0

//Take value in R2, and value1, then add them and store in R2
